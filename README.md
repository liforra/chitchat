# ChitChat Theme Extension

This extension enhances the ChitChat experience by providing a highly customizable theme engine and additional utility features. Tailor the chat interface to your personal preferences with various color presets, visual effects, and functional improvements.

## Features

*   **Customizable Theme Presets:** Choose from a range of built-in color palettes including `Purple`, `Blue`, `Orange`, `Red`, `Pink`, `Green`, and `AMOLED`. Each preset offers a distinct visual style.
*   **Soft Theme Intensity:** Opt for a "Soft Lavender" theme intensity for a gentler, less vibrant aesthetic, available alongside the default "Shades of Purple".
*   **Frosted Glass Surface:** Apply a unique "Frosted Glass" effect to UI elements for a modern, semi-transparent look.
*   **Compact Mode:** Reduce the spacing and padding of UI elements to achieve a more compact layout, ideal for smaller screens or denser information display.
*   **Custom Color Palette:** Unleash your creativity by defining your own primary and accent colors using intuitive color pickers. Includes an "Apply" button for performance, ensuring updates only occur when you're ready.
*   **Disable Theme Option:** Easily revert to ChitChat's default styling by selecting the "None" preset in the theme settings.
*   **Add Friend by ID:** A convenient utility integrated directly into the friend requests menu, allowing you to send friend requests by entering a user's unique ID.

## Installation (Signed .crx File)

If you have a signed extension file (e.g., a `.crx` file), installation is very straightforward.

1.  **Download the Extension:**
    *   Obtain the signed extension file (e.g., `chitchat-extension.crx`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/liforra/chitchat/releases).

2.  **Open Extensions Management Page:**
    *   Open your browser (e.g., Chrome, Brave, Edge).
    *   Navigate to the extensions management page. You can typically do this by typing `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`, `edge://extensions`) into the address bar and pressing Enter.

3.  **Drag and Drop:**
    *   Ensure "Developer mode" is **enabled** (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).
    *   Locate the downloaded `.crx` file on your computer.
    *   **Drag and drop the `.crx` file directly onto the `chrome://extensions` page.**

The ChitChat Theme extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions and be active. You might need to refresh any open ChitChat tabs for the theme to take effect.

## Usage

After installation, refresh any open ChitChat tabs. You will find a new gear icon (⚙️) next to the existing friend button. Click this icon to open the extension settings panel and explore the customization options.
