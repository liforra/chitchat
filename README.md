# ChitChat Theme Extension

This extension enhances the ChitChat experience by providing a highly customizable theme engine and additional utility features. Tailor the chat interface to your personal preferences with various color presets, visual effects, and functional improvements.

## Features

*   **Customizable Theme Presets:** Choose from a range of built-in color palettes including `Purple`, `Blue`, `Orange`, `Red`, `Pink`, `Green`, and `AMOLED`. Each preset offers a distinct visual style.
*   **Soft Theme Intensity:** Opt for a "Soft Lavender" theme intensity for a gentler, less vibrant aesthetic, available alongside the default "Shades of Purple".
*   **Frosted Glass Surface:** Apply a unique "Frosted Glass" effect to UI elements for a modern, semi-transparent look.
*   **Compact Mode:** Reduce the spacing and padding of UI elements to achieve a more compact layout, ideal for smaller screens or denser information display.
*   **Custom Color Palette:** Unleash your creativity by defining your own primary and accent colors using intuitive color pickers. Includes an "Apply" button for performance, ensuring updates only occur when you're ready.
*   **Disable Theme Option:** Easily revert to ChitChat's default styling by selecting the "None" preset in the theme settings.
*   **Add Friend by ID:** A convenient utility integrated directly into the friend requests menu, allowing you to send friend requests by entering a user's unique ID.
